Dear <%= @group.liaison.first_name %>,

Thank you for registering your group with Sierra Service Project!  Plans for next summer are falling
into place, and we are thrilled your group will be a part of it.  We have just finished the process
of scheduling 124 churches for the summer, totaling over 1,665 participants.  This is another wonderful
blessing but also made for a challenging process. Despite this, we are pleased to announce that 98% of
the groups were placed in their first or second choice.

This email is your confirmation that your group has been scheduled in the following session:

Site:                       <%= @group.session.site.name %>
Week:                       <%= @group.session.period.name %>
Start Date:                 <%= @group.session.period.start_date.strftime("%a, %b %d, %Y") %>
End Date:                   <%= @group.session.period.end_date.strftime("%a, %b %d, %Y")  %>


The following is the current information that we have on your group:

We will be updating our current availability on our website early next week. Also, the MySSP portal will
remain offline over the weekend and be accessible early next week.  Please call the office to discuss any
additions to your group at (916) 488-6441.

If you have any questions or concerns, please give me a call at 916-488-6441. Email will be my primary way
of communicating with you, so please notify me if you change your email address.

Blessings,
